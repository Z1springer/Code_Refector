# Code_Refector




In this project we were instructed to give the html page the proper semantic tags in place of the overused div tag. In doing so we will better understand the need to proper identification of various parts of a webpage for future use. This is also meant to accustom us to the usage of these semantic tags so if and when we run into employers who require the use of them, we are better prepared.
This project also had us not alter, but reorganise the css style page. Making it more space efficient and in turn organising it so that classes that have identical attributes and stylings can be impacted by only one line of code. 
All alterations and editorials made have been flagged with a comment on the line above each respectively.
